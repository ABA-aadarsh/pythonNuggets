Minuend=200
Subtrahend=123
Using 9's complement,

9's complement of 123 is
	 999
	-123
	=> 876
Adding with 200, we get,
	 876
	+200
	=> 1076
Since there is overflow digit, answer will be positive and 
be obtained by removing the over flow digit with the last result without overflow digit,

Hence the answer is, 077
